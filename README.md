# sql-data-analytics-project
A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more.
This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.

Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analytics using SQL, combining both Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Advanced Analytics for real-world business datasets. The workflow and methodology are structured as visualized below.

Methodological Breakdown
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is the foundation for any data-driven project. This step encompasses:

Database Exploration: Initial assessment of tables, data types, and relationships.

Dimensions Exploration: Analyzing categorical variables and hierarchies.

Date Exploration: Examining temporal dimensions and extracting meaningful date parts.

Measures Exploration: Identifying key numerical metrics (“big numbers”).

Magnitude Analysis: Quantifying and visualizing the scale of business metrics.

Ranking: Pinpointing top/bottom entities (e.g., customers, products, periods).

2. Advanced Analytics
Building on the EDA, advanced analytics enables deeper business insights:

Change-Over-Time Analysis: Detecting trends and seasonality using temporal aggregations.

Cumulative Analysis: Calculating running totals and cumulative growth patterns.

Performance Analysis: Benchmarking actual performance against targets or historical data.

Part-to-Whole (Proportional) Analysis: Understanding how parts contribute to the whole (e.g., pie charts, percentage-of-total).

Data Segmentation: Breaking down datasets into meaningful segments for targeted analysis.

Reporting: Converting insights into clear, actionable reports and dashboards for stakeholders.

Project Deliverables
SQL scripts for each analysis type (EDA + advanced).

Step-by-step documentation for setting up the analysis and interpreting each technique.

Sample reports and/or dashboards illustrating insights derived from the methodology.

Reusable methodology: This structured workflow can easily be applied to diverse business domains and datasets.

How to Use
Run the SQL scripts in order, following the mapped methodology for your business case.

Use the insights from each step (from EDA through segmentation and reporting) to build compelling visualizations or inform business strategies.

Reference the provided documentation for adapting queries and techniques to your own schema and requirements.
